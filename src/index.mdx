## SABC Election Dataviz Widgets

This is a collection of widgets used to visualise election data, both historical as well as live counts on the day of the elections. There are various widgets available to configure for use within your websites. Each widget has optional configuration settings allowing you to choose certain display options, before generating the required embed code.

## Note on municipalities

Some widgets can be configured to show a specific municipality. Municipality codes rather than names should be used. For instance Cape Town is CPT. Find a complete list of codes here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_municipalities_in_South_Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_municipalities_in_South_Africa) 

## Performance

This widget library still under development. Some queries may be slow but expect them to be optimised soon.
