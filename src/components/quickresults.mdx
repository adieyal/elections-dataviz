## Quick Results

The Quick Results Widget is composed of multiple sub-widgets and covers most of the election reporting scenarios. It allows for navigation using either a geographic map or a menu. Different resultsets are available using the buttons running along the top. A dark mode stylesheet has been created as a starting point for TV graphics.
